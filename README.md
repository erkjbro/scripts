# SCRIPTS
A collection of scripts that are stored together for easy access. Mainly for env setups.

## MISC

1) vars.sh

Just testing an option for handling vars.

## VM

### Amazon Linux 2

1) basic-httpd.sh

This script was in an AWS course that I'm taking on Udemy. It's a simple way to get something running
on the ec2 instance that can help with testing load balancing, acs, alb, etc. Nothing fancy.
